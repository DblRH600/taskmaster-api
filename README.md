# Mod15 SBA: Backend Develpoment

This is a solution using Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, bcryot, jsonwebtoken, and dotenv to build out [Module 14 SBA](https://ps-lms.vercel.app/curriculum/se/419).

TaskMaster is a RESTful API for managing users, projects, and tasks. It uses JWT-based authentication and enforces ownership-based authorization to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## Overview

This is a capstone project designed to synthesize the skills learned across multiple modules. It is designed to plan and execute the development of a real-world, secure, and functional RESTful API from the ground up. Success will require careful planning, clean code, and a solid understanding of authentication and authorization principles.

This project emphasizes the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle. You are strongly encouraged to reference, reuse, and adapt the code and patterns you have developed in the labs and lessons from previous modules.

### Key Concepts

- Client-Server Separation: The frontend and backend operate independently. Clients interact with the server via clearly defined endpoints (URIs).

- Stateless Requests: Each request includes all necessary information. The server does not remember previous interactions.

- Uniform Interface:

  - Resource-Based URLs: Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., /api/products).

  - HTTP Methods (Full CRUD Implementation):

    - GET: Retrieve data
    - POST: Create new data
    - PUT / PATCH: Update data
    - DELETE: Remove data
    - QUERY: Search and Filter data based on search criteria

  - Standard Format: Data is exchanged in JSON.

- Authentication and Authorization

Understanding these REST principles is essential before working with or extending this API.

### What I learned

Building the _TaskMaster-API_ tested my understanding of **_Express_**, **_Mongoose_**, and how to set up the **_Project Structure & Configuration_** correctly. Additionally, the project further tested my understanding of how to setup **_express.Router()_** routes as well as futher practice with utilizing **try** / **catch** blocks for **error** handling using **_async_** / **_await_** functions and implementing full **CRUD** functions.

```js Project Schema
import mongoose, { Schema } from "mongoose";

const projectSchema = new Schema({
  name: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    trim: true,
  },
  description: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  user: {
    type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: "User",
    required: true,
  },
  tasks: [
    {
      type: Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: "Task",
    },
  ],
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
});

const Project = mongoose.model("Project", projectSchema);

export default Project;
```

```js projects route
import express from 'express'
import { authMiddleware as protect } from '../utils/auth.js'
import Project from '../models/Project.js'

const router = express.Router()
router.use(protect)

/**
 * POST api/projects
 * @description route for project creation
 */
router.post('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const project = await Project.create({
      ...req.body,
      user: req.user._id
    })
    res.status(201).json(project)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
    res.status(400).json({ message: err.message })
  }
})

/**
 * PUT api/projects/:id
 * @description route for updating project data
 */
router.put('/:id', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const projectUpdate = await Project.findById(req.params.id)

    if (!projectUpdate) {
      return res
        .status(404)
        .json({ message: 'Project not found under this id' })
    }

    if (!projectUpdate.user.equals(req.user._id)) {
      return res
        .status(403)
        .json({ message: 'Updates to this project are authorized by the user' })
    }

    await projectUpdate.set(req.body).save()

    res.json(projectUpdate)
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err)
    res.status(500).json({ message: err.message })
  }
})
```

### Continued development

There is still a _well_ of _informaiton_ to learn and _apply_ regarding the use of **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, **JSON WEB Token** and the many functions and performances that can be used in setting up a **server**. Gaining a deeper understanding of full **CRUD** implementation will help with the next phases of **_Full-Stack_** Development; establishing the **Front-End** to **Server** to **DataBase** connection.

### Reflections

### Useful resources

- [EXPRESSJS.COM](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res.sendFile) - **_expressjs.com_** contains well documented information details about **routes**.

- [MONGOOSE](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html) - **_mongoosejs.com_** can be used to deepen one's understanding about the functionality **mongoose** is capable of performing that can be incorporated into a **server**.

- [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/) - **_restfulapi.net_** provides background information and tutroials on how to build web-based **APIs** (_Application Programming Interfaces_).

## Overview

This is a capstone project designed to synthesize the skills learned across multiple modules. It is designed to plan and execute the development of a real-world, secure, and functional RESTful API from the ground up. Success will require careful planning, clean code, and a solid understanding of authentication and authorization principles.

This project emphasizes the DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principle. You are strongly encouraged to reference, reuse, and adapt the code and patterns you have developed in the labs and lessons from previous modules.

### Key Concepts
- Client-Server Separation: The frontend and backend operate independently. Clients interact with the server via clearly defined endpoints (URIs).

- Stateless Requests: Each request includes all necessary information. The server does not remember previous interactions.

- Uniform Interface:
    - Resource-Based URLs: Use nouns to represent resources (e.g., /api/products).

    - HTTP Methods (Full CRUD Implementation):
        - GET: Retrieve data
        - POST: Create new data
        - PUT / PATCH: Update data
        - DELETE: Remove data
        - QUERY: Search and Filter data based on search criteria

    - Standard Format: Data is exchanged in JSON.

- Authentication and Authorization

Understanding these REST principles is essential before working with or extending this API.

### What I learned

Building the *Zenith-API* tested my understanding of ***Express***, ***Mongoose***, and how to set up the ***Project Structure & Configuration*** correctly. Additionally, the project further tested my understanding of how to setup ***express.Router()*** routes as well as futher practice with utilizing **try** / **catch** blocks for **error** handling using ***async*** / ***await*** functions and implementing full **CRUD** functions.


```js 
```

### Continued development

There is still a *well* of *informaiton* to learn and *apply* regarding the use of **Express**, **MongoDB**, **Mongoose**, and the many functions and performances that can be used in setting up a **server**. Gaining a deeper understanding of full **CRUD** implementation will help with the next phases of ***Full-Stack*** Development; establishing the **Front-End** to **Server** to **DataBase** connection.

### Reflections

### Useful resources

- [EXPRESSJS.COM](https://expressjs.com/en/5x/api.html#res.sendFile) - ***expressjs.com*** contains well documented information details about **routes**.

- [MONGOOSE](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/index.html) - ***mongoosejs.com*** can be used to deepen one's understanding about the functionality **mongoose** is capable of performing that can be incorporated into a **server**.

- [REST API Tutorial](https://restfulapi.net/) - ***restfulapi.net*** provides background information and tutroials on how to build web-based **APIs** (*Application Programming Interfaces*).
